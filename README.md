Welcome to ViewerVoice, the tool that allows you to gain insights into what viewers have commented under a YouTube video. Social analytics tools, such as ViewerVoice, help content creators better understand their audience and allow for data-driven decision making, enabling them to strategise and build their brand. In addition, it can help brands understand the audience of potential creators they are looking to partner with. Through this tool, we demonstrate how text modelling can provide actionable insights in social analytics.
